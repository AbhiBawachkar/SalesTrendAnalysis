## Situation

In this project, I worked with a dataset containing sales data from 2015 to 2017, covering various regions, products, and sales representatives. The dataset included information such as the date of sale, sales representative, region, product details, units sold, and revenue generated.

## Task

My task was to analyze the sales data, derive meaningful insights, and present them in a clear and visually appealing manner. I aimed to understand patterns in sales, identify top-performing products, sales representatives, and regions, and provide recommendations to improve revenue in the following year.

## Action

I began by loading the dataset into a pandas DataFrame, cleaned and preprocessed the data, and performed descriptive statistics to get an overview of the sales entries. I visualized the distribution of revenue and units sold, ensuring a clear understanding of the data.

To understand revenue generation across different dimensions, I created visualizations for revenue by region, sales representative, and product. Additionally, I explored the sales trend over the years, pinpointing the most profitable months and highlighting the symmetrical trend in October 2017 and 2018.

I delved into the monthly product sales, identified top-selling products, and correlated regional sales with revenue. I concluded by analyzing yearly changes in revenue and identifying the top three products.

## Result

The analysis revealed that the West region generated the most revenue, and sales representative Mike slightly outperformed Julie in revenue generation. Bellen, Quad, and Sunbell emerged as the top-selling products, and the best months for sales were September, October, and November.

## Insights

- The best months for sales are September, October and November. The company should look into creating jingles during these periods to further maximize profit.
- Focus the ad targeted audience onÂ `East and South Regions`
- Finally Bellen and Quad sell most during these periods consider getting more of them.

## Reflection

I recommended creating promotional campaigns during peak sales months, focusing marketing efforts on the East and South regions, and increasing inventory for top-selling products like Bellen and Quad.

This comprehensive analysis provides actionable insights for the company to optimize its strategies and potentially increase revenue in the following year.
